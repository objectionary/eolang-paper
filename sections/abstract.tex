\begin{abstract}
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is one of the most popular paradigms used for building software systems%

  the rendered version is \href{https://github.com/REPOSITORY/releases/tag/0.0.0}{\ff{0.0.0}}.}.
However, despite its industrial and academic popularity,
  OOP is still missing a formal apparatus similar to \(\lambda\)-calculus,
  which functional programming is based on.
There were a number of attempts to formalize OOP, but none of them managed
  to cover all the features available in modern OO programming languages, such as C++ or Java.
We have made yet another attempt and created \phic{}.
We also created EOLANG (also called \eolang{}), an experimental programming language based on \phic{}.
This paper does not demonstrate the practical use or effect of \phic{} or \eolang{}, but merely explains them.
