This is the first paper about 𝜑-calculus.

The reference interpreter is [phino].

To build it, just run:

```bash
make
```

You need to have [LaTeX], [GNU Aspell], [jq], [texsc], and [texqc] installed.

You may also want to check whether your LaTeX installation has
  all the packages required in the `DEPENDS.txt` file.
If you miss any of them, install, for example, with the help of [tlmgr].

Once compiled and packaged, upload zip archive
to [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13384).
